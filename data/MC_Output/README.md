# MC Output

created using the UNC Longleaf HPC cluster.

There are 12 RData files, named `results1.RData` through `results12.RData`.

To download them, please click this

to access the Dropbox folder in which the files are stored (individually and
together they are too large for GitHub's file size limits). Click *Download*
to download the folder to your computer as a zipped folder. Then, extract the 
folder's files (i.e. "unzip" the folder) into this very folder. In order for
the replication materials to work, you will want to have all 12 files in
the `data/MC_Output/` folder of the version of this repository on your computer.
